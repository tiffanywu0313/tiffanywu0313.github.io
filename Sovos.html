    <!-- <h1><b>What I did during the Internship</b></h1>
    <p>
      The goal of this research was to understand the current scheduling tool market, evaluate
      whether there was value in iterating on the When2meet tool, and understand the existing
      problems and pain points users are running into in the scheduling process.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>1. Competitive Analysis</b><br>
     In order to better understand the scheduling tool product space, I spearheaded the competitive
     analysis on products similar to When2meet such as LettuceMeet, Calenderly, and Doodle. We
     learned that while there are many scheduling services, <b>most free tools had very basic or
     minimal features</b> and required the user to pay for advanced scheduling features.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>2. User Survey</b><br>
    We then collected <b>78 survey responses</b> which helped us understand how users currently used
    scheduling tools and their context; as well as pain points they ran into and features they
    would like to see.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>3. User Interview</b><br>
    After confirming that there are pain points in the current scheduling process, we recruited 4
    participants through <b>convenient sampling</b> to run a <b>semi-structured</b> interview and usability test
    on When2meet. We used an affinity diagram to analyze the qualitative data.
   </p>

    <br>


    <h1><b>Synthetic Models</b></h1>
    <p>
      Based on the research data, we synthesized two personas that we wanted to focus on
      serving in our re-thought version of the scheduling tool When2meet. We referred to
      these personas frequently throughout the design and development process to align everyone
      on the features we wanted to prioritize.

      <h1><b>Design Principles</b></h1>
      <p>
        I consolidated the research findings and user pain points into key design principles our
        solution would follow. This made communicating with other designers and engineers easier.

      <br>


      <h1><b>Ideation</b></h1>
      <p>
        With the design principles and requirements in mind, I started to ideate solutions.
        Below are a couple rough ideas I had in the process. I then discussed with the other
        designer to combine ideas and we eliminated ideas that did not tie back to our design
        principles and explored the remaining ones.

      <h1><b>Takeaways</b></h1>
      <!-- <p>
        I really enjoyed my time at Sovos as a UX Design Intern. I think the internship program was
        very well structured and I absolutely adored everyone on the North American Design Team.
        Although our team wasn’t the largest, we had like 6/7 designers in total but I could really feel
        that each person brought with them their unique set of skills and perspectives and it was always
        super insightful to ask for feedback because everyone would have different thoughts.
      </p>
      <h5><b>Takeaways</b></h5> -->
      <p>
        <b>1. Working with Content</b><br>
        This was the first time that I got to work with a dedicated content team. I really learned a
        lot from our content designer about the importance of content. Good content takes the  guessing
        away from the user and instead replaces it with “knowing”. Users shouldn’t ever have to guess
        what a button does, rather, they should “know” what it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Working with Design Systems</b><br>
        This was also the first time that I got to help maintain and use a comprehensive design system.
        It’s very interesting to see how each atom is the building block of a whole page or product
        and there are a lot of things to consider when crafting design system elements such as accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. B2B product pain points</b><br>
        I’ve noticed that interviewing B2B product users is different from interviewing customers/end users.
        Sovos users are usually experts since they use the interface regularly. Thus, when asked what could
        be better about the interface they are often at a standstill and need more time to think.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Domain knowledge and getting context</b><br>
        One of the main things I learned during my internship was picking up on domain knowledge quickly
        and getting enough context for my projects. I don’t need to know everything about a product to work
        on individual projects but rather I need to figure out what is within the scope of my project and
        ask questions so I get enough context that I can unblock myself and get started.
      </p>
