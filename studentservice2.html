        <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
        <p>
          UBC UX Lab is a hands-on program under UBC Student Communication Services where
          students learn about user experience and conduct experiments to improve the services
          that UBC provides its students.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was part of the summer 2019 cohort and our first project was to conduct a usability
          study on the newly launched Transfer Credit Search Tool to understand how stakeholders
          are navigating the tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Transfer Credit Search Tool was launched on June 2, 2019 by UBC Student Communication
          Services to assist advisors and students. Prior to the launch, three phases of usability
          testing were already performed on the design by UBC staff.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Research Question</b></h1>
        <p>
          How are students and stakeholders navigating the newly launched UBC Transfer Credit Search Tool?
        </p>
        <div class="photo">
          <img src="./images/transferpreview.png"  alt="tp">
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Research Methodology</b></h1>
        <p>
          We decide to evaluate the tool by running remote moderated scenario tests on stakeholders
          with the talk-aloud method. During the scenario test, we asked the participants to look
          up 2 courses in the tool and explain what the credits transfer to at UBC. The following
          is a rough overview of our test flow:
        </p>
        <div class="photo">
          <img src="./images/testflow.png"  alt="tf">
        </div>
        <p>
          The usability study consisted of:<br>
          1. Pre-screen Questionnaire: this allowed us to better understand the background of each user,
          such as what school they were transferring from, and what they were studying.<br>
          2. Scenario Task: this allowed us to find the pain points in the user flow and take notice
          of certain functions that were not as intuitive.<br>
          3. Follow-up Questions: this allowed us to understand why the user may have experienced certain
           issues and investigate the root cause of the pain points that arose during the scenario task.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Data Analysis</b></h1>
        <p>
        As multiple pre-launch testings had already been conducted, we tested a smaller sample of
        7 participants (4 advisors, 3 students). To analyze the data, we created an affinity diagram
        to categorize similar trends.
        </p>

          </div>
          <br>
          <br>


          <h1><b>Key Findings</b></h1>
          <p>
          1. Error message confusing: Users were unsure whether the error ‘No Results Found’
          meant the course would not transfer at all or was still awaiting evaluation. Users
          were confused by the vagueness of the error message and felt further clarification
          was needed.
          </p>
          <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/errormessage.png"  alt="ut">
          </div>
          <p>
          2. Course code inconsistencies in UBC database: The tool showed the course would
          not transfer when the user indicated it was supposed to, or the course code was not
          the same between UBC and other school databases. This finding allowed us to conclude
          that there were certain inaccuracies within the UBC database, creating mistrust in
          the users.
          </p>
          <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/inconsistent.png"  alt="ut">
          </div>
          <p>
            'Change Search' button: This button was meant to be an easy way for users to return
            to the search page without having to re-input general information such as institution
            name - users found the button difficult to find or expected it to be somewhere else.
          </p>
          <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/changesearch.png"  alt="ut">
          </div>
          <p>

            <br>


          <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
          <p>
            Some limitations we have in this study was the lack of participants. Although the tool
             had already undergone three phases of pre-launch usability testing, we would have
             benefited from a larger sample size. Of the student participants that were tested,
             all three of them were transferring into the Faculty of Science, we may have gained
             more representative data and insight and if we ran tests on students transferring into
             other faculties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some improvements that can be made for a better user experience would be to make the
            ‘Change Search’ button more obvious or put it in a more identifiable location,
            specifying the error message, improving data reliability, and increasing exposure
            by improving the SEO of this product.
