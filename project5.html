        <h1><b>Problem</b></h1>
        <p>
          Hospitals and research institutes across Canada have lots of biospecimen samples they
          have collected from patients over the years in their inventory, however, they lack the
          correct channels to communicate with individual researchers who need these samples.
          On the other hand, researchers have a hard time finding the right specimen samples they
          need for their research and grant writing as they have to reach out to each institution
          individually.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus, came the idea to build a National Specimen Inventory where partner
         institutions in Canada could list their specimen samples and researchers could browse for
         the samples that they needed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1><b>Defining the User Flow</b></h1>
        <p>
          Before going straight to building, I worked with my Supervisor and Project
          Manager to define the basic user flow of the app.
        </p>
        <div class="photo">
          <img src="./images/process.jpg"  alt="userflow">
        </div>
        <p>
          On the institution side, each institution has to periodically provide a list of
          available specimen samples to a data manager (who will be appointed at a later time).
        </p>
        <p>
          On the researcher side, individual researchers who are part of the National Specimen
          Inventory (NANSI) would have to register and request access to the database web app.
          After the researchers are approved, they can browse and reach out to the institutions
          with samples that they are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data manager will be the one updating the specimen database and giving researchers
          access to the database.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Process:</b></h1>
        <p>
          With the user flow down, I started building the initial prototype. Each week I would
          present the parts of the web app that I had worked and issues I was stuck on and my
          supervisor and team members would give me feedback and suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
          By mid Febuary, my project manager and I presented my working MVP prototype to our 15+
          stakeholders (representatives from the institutions we were working with). I recieved a
          lot of feedback and requests such as more complex filters and specific fields to include
          for the specimen data.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the rest of my co-op term, I worked on finishing the authentication system, unifying
          the database fields, fixing bugs, and building the multiple condition filter. With the help
          of the senior programmer on the team, I was able to get through all the issues I got stuck
          on before launching. Of course, I also tested the web app extensively and documented the
          test cases as well as how app was built.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

          <h1><b>Reflection:</b></h1>
          <p>
            This was the first time I had the opportunity to work on such a large scale project both
            in terms of timeline and impact. Most of the time I was working alone on the project and
            felt like my code didn’t really make a difference, it was only when i shared with the team
            and stakeholders did I realize the potential impact my code would make.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before this co-op term, I had never used SQL before and had no knowledge of relational
            databases, so I had to learn as I built the product. At first, I had planned the database
            structure to be one way, but later realized that it wouldn’t work at all and had to toss
            the idea away and start from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, I had never built an authentication system for users before and it was very
             interesting learning about all the different ways to encrypt user data and decrypt the
              password to see if it was correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I’d like to have done is input the specimen sample data from institutions and
            see the web app in action. However, due to the time constraint, I ended my co-op term
            before the different institutions had the data ready.
          </p>
