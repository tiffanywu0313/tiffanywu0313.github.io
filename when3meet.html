     <b>Redesigning the scheduling tool When2meet to better meet students' needs.</b>
   </h1>
   <p>
     <b>Tools Used:</b> Figma, Miro, Zoom, Google Survey, Google Sheets, Pen and Paper.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Responsibilities:</b>  I worked in a team of 10 students, consisting of 2 UX designers
     (including myself) and 8 software developers over two school terms. Some of my responsibilities
     included conducting competitive analysis on similar existing products as well as user
     surveys and user interviews to understand how students use scheduling tools. I also created
     lo-fi wireframes, mid-fi prototypes, and hi-fi prototypes through multiple iterations.
   </p>
   <br>
   <br>

   <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
   <p>
     As students, we often have to schedule meetings for group projects or extracurricular
     involvement. The scheduling tool that we use most often is called When2meet. However,
     this platform isn’t the easiest to navigate. Thus, we wanted to iterate on When2meet and
     add more features to make scheduling meetings a less cumbersome process.
   </p>

     <div class="researchtext">
       <h1><b>Challenge</b></h1>
       <p>
         How are students currently navigating the When2meet scheduling tool and how can we
         make the process more efficient and less cumbersome?
       </p>

<div class="overview">
    <h1><b>Research</b></h1>
    <p>
      The goal of this research was to understand the current scheduling tool market, evaluate
      whether there was value in iterating on the When2meet tool, and understand the existing
      problems and pain points users are running into in the scheduling process.
      <!-- Link to the full research report. -->
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>1. Competitive Analysis</b><br>
     In order to better understand the scheduling tool product space, I spearheaded the competitive
     analysis on products similar to When2meet such as LettuceMeet, Calenderly, and Doodle. We
     learned that while there are many scheduling services, <b>most free tools had very basic or
     minimal features</b> and required the user to pay for advanced scheduling features.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>2. User Survey</b><br>
    We then collected <b>78 survey responses</b> which helped us understand how users currently used
    scheduling tools and their context; as well as pain points they ran into and features they
    would like to see.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>3. User Interview</b><br>
    After confirming that there are pain points in the current scheduling process, we recruited 4
    participants through <b>convenient sampling</b> to run a <b>semi-structured</b> interview and usability test
    on When2meet. We used an affinity diagram to analyze the qualitative data.
   </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Research Insights</b></h1>
    <p>
      The goal of the user interview was to understand the existing problems and pain points users
      are running into in the scheduling process.

    </div>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Synthetic Models</b></h1>
    <p>
      Based on the research data, we synthesized two personas that we wanted to focus on
      serving in our re-thought version of the scheduling tool When2meet. We referred to
      these personas frequently throughout the design and development process to align everyone
      on the features we wanted to prioritize.

      <br>
      <br>

      <h1><b>Design Principles</b></h1>
      <p>
        I consolidated the research findings and user pain points into key design principles our
        solution would follow. This made communicating with other designers and engineers easier.

      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Ideation</b></h1>
      <p>
        With the design principles and requirements in mind, I started to ideate solutions.
        Below are a couple rough ideas I had in the process. I then discussed with the other
        designer to combine ideas and we eliminated ideas that did not tie back to our design
        principles and explored the remaining ones.

      We tested with 2-3 users between each of the low-fi, mid-fi, and hi-fi prototypes. In addition,
      we presented our design to the team every week and received feedback which also informed
      some changes to the design.

      <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <h5><b>What I learned</b></h5>
      <p>
        <b>1. Advocating for research</b><br>
        Since I worked with a team of mostly developers, a lot of them have not really had exposure
        to design or were aware of what user experience was. Thus, I tried my best to clearly explain
        the importance of reason for research and presented my progress of research and design
        every week to make sure the developers felt engaged in the project. As the more senior
        designer on the team, I also spearheaded the design process and pushed for the features
        that we build based on research data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Discussing Design</b><br>
        In my past design experience, I was almost always the only UX designer (e.g during my
        internships). So it was very refreshing to work with another designer who had a very
        different perspective to bounce ideas off each other. In the early stages of the design
        process, we ideated solutions separately and came together at our weekly meeting to talk
        about our designs and the reasoning behind it. We almost always came with a different
        perspective and it reminded me of how exciting it is to discuss design and how design
        is more cohesive as a collaborative effort.
      </p>
      <h5><b>Limitations</b></h5>
      <p>
        Our research was mostly conducted within our school community (UBC), which may not be
        representative of other universities/colleges. Perhaps surveying and doing user research
        with participants from a more diverse pool would make our research and product more
        generalizable among the wider student population.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time was limited, we were not able to develop all the features we wanted to add to
        the scheduling tool before the school year ended. This was due to the lack of time and
        expertise of our student developers, which is understandable as most students have a
        full course load, not as much experience, and other priorities to tend to. However,
        we were able to get the MVP running which was mostly focused on event creation and
        calendar schedulability.
      </p>
      <h5><b>Future Direction</b></h5>
      <p>
        If we had more time, I would have liked to <b>test the account creation flow and dashboard
        visualizations</b>. The dashboard visualizations were mainly tested on people in the team
        and club who already had prior knowledge of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if the product is launched, after the users have had some time to adjust and use
        our tool, conducting a <b>card sort on feature priority/usefulness</b> would be insightful to
        see if users actually use and value the added flexibility of synchronizing schedules etc.
      </p>
