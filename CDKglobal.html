   <p>
     <b>Tools Used:</b> Google Docs, Google Forms, Zoom, Otter.ai, Figjam, Figma.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Duration:</b> 8 weeks.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Responsibilities:</b> I worked in a team of 4 UX researchers including myself, who were all
     students. Some of my responsibilities included writing up the research plan, creating the screening
     survey and interview questions, recruiting and interviewing participants, coding interviews, and
     analyzing findings to form actionable insights.
   </p>
   <p>
     My contributions are heavily emphasized in these areas of the project: creating the screening survey
     questions and form, as well as recruiting 5 participants through convenience sampling and being the
     lead interviewer of 6 out of 8 participants.
   </p>
   <br>
   <br>

   <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
   <p>
     As part of my INF 385T - Advanced Usability class, we partnered with CDK Global, a company that provides
      software that facilitates sales for auto dealerships; to help their UX research team understand how
      dealership actions and behaviors influence customer decision-making in the car-buying process.
   </p>
   <p>
     From CDK’s perspective, dealers tend to go through a lot of unnecessary steps to sell, thus, we want
     to discover opportunity areas that could enhance the car-buying process. For this project, we were tasked
     with choosing methods, conducting research, and <b><i>were constrained to not interact with dealerships.</i></b>

       <h1><b>Research Questions</b></h1>
       <p>
         How do customers perceive and respond to different dealership actions and behaviors when making a purchasing decision?
       </p>
       <p>
         To what extent do customers prioritize dealership behaviors compared to other factors such as price, brand
         reputation, or product features when making a purchasing decision?
       </p>

<div class="overview">
    <h1><b>Goal</b></h1>
    <p>
     1. Identify opportunity areas for enhancing the car-buying process for customers.
   </p>
   <p>
    2. Provide actionable insights on customer thoughts and behavior to CDK Global.
   </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Methodology</b></h1>
    <p>
      For our research, we went with <b>in-depth semi-structured interviews</b> that lasted 45-60 min. This
      method was chosen as we could not interact with dealerships which eliminated the opportunity for
      more observational methods like contextual inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>Before recruitment, we floated a <b>screener survey</b> to ensure that participants met the criteria we
      set, these included:<br>
      <br>
        1. Above 18 years of age<br>
        2. People who have bought cars post 2020 or am currently in the process of buying a car<br>
        3. Primary decision maker for the car purchase<br>
    </p>
    <p>{This project’s aim was to provide actionable insights for CDK’s CMS design concept — the CMS was updated
      post COVID to facilitate online purchases. This, we only interviewed customers who have bought cars/wish to
       buy cars post COVID (2020)}
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Demographics</b></h1>

      <h1><b>Executive Summary</b></h1>
      <p>
        The <b>behavior of a dealership</b> is a crucial factor in <b>determining customer satisfaction</b>
        during the car-buying process.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the <b>price of the vehicle</b> remains the <b>most significant factor</b> that influences a
        customer's decision on where to purchase a car.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many customers perceive that <b>dealers prioritize customer acquisition over retention</b>, which can lead to
        dissatisfaction with after-sales services and reduced loyalty towards the dealership.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Research Insights</b></h1>
      <p>
        Following our research, we identified two primary customer segments: <br>
        <br>
          1. Noobs - Individuals who are relatively new to car-buying<br>
          2. Seasoned - Individuals who have prior car-buying experience through
          first-hand experience or second-hand observation<br>
      </p>

      <h1><b>Areas of Opportunity</b></h1>
      <p>
      <div class="photo">
        <img src="./images/8CDKGlobal/Opportunities.png"  alt="Opportunities">

     </p>
      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <h5><b>Limitations</b></h5>
      <p>
        One of the major limitations that we had during our research was <b>not being able to talk to
        dealers</b> and make a direct comparison between what dealers expect their actions to do and how
        customers perceive/react to it. We also mostly interviewed people that bought cars in Austin,
        Texas, thus are <b>not sure if our research is generalizable to the larger population.</b>
      </p>
      <h5><b>Future Direction</b></h5>
      <p>
        If we had more time, I would love to conduct more research on areas such as comparing <b>pre-covid
        to post-covid</b> dealership behaviors and <b>online versus in person </b>dealership inquiries.
      </p>
