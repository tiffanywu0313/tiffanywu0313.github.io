       <p>
         <b>Responsibilities:</b> I was part of a team of 4 student researchers, one lab coordinator,
        and one full time ux designer. All student researchers participated throughout the research process
        from May to July 2019. Some of my responsibilities included conducting usability studies,
        affinity diagram analysis, presenting findings, and report writing.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>

        <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
        <p>
          UBC UX Lab is a hands-on program under UBC Student Communication Services where
          students learn about user experience and conduct experiments to improve the services
          that UBC provides its students.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was part of the summer 2019 cohort and I worked on two projects during my time as a
           UX student researcher, including conducting usability studies on the Transfer credit search
           tool and the <a href="./studentservice.html"><b>“What can I do with my Science Degree”</b></a> webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will be focusing on the Transfer Credit Search tool usability study below. You can read
          more about the "What can I do with my Science Degree” project
          <a href="./studentservice2.html"><b>here</b></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Transfer Credit Search Tool was launched on June 2, 2019 by UBC Student Communication
          Services to assist advisors and students. Prior to the launch, three phases of usability
          testing were already performed on the tool by UBC staff. Our goal was to understand how
          stakeholders are navigating the tool and to find if there are pain points.

            <h1><b>Research Question</b></h1>
            <p>
              How are students and stakeholders navigating the newly launched UBC Transfer Credit Search Tool?

        <div class="overview">
        <h1><b>Research Methodology</b></h1>
        <p>
          To evaluate the tool, we ran <b>remote moderated scenario tests</b> on different stakeholders
          that consisted of a pre-screen questionnaire, a scenario task, and follow up questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability study flow:<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Pre-screen Questionnaire: this allowed us to better understand the background of each user,
          such as what school they were transferring from, and what they were studying.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Scenario Task: stakeholders were asked to look up 2 courses in the tool and explain what
          the credits transfer to at UBC using the <b>talk aloud</b> method. This allowed us to find
          the pain points in the user flow and take notice of certain functions that were not as
          intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Follow-up Questions: this allowed us to understand why the user may have experienced certain
           issues and investigate the root cause of the pain points that arose during the scenario task.
        </p>

        <br>


        <h1><b>Data Analysis</b></h1>
        <p>
        As multiple pre-launch testings had already been conducted, we tested a smaller sample of
        7 participants (4 advisors, 3 students). To analyze the data, we conducted an affinity diagram
        analysis to categorize similar patterns and trends.

          </div>
          <br>
          <br>


          <h1><b>Key Findings</b></h1>
          <p>
          <b>1. Error message confusing:</b> Users were unsure whether the error ‘No Results Found’
          meant the course would not transfer at all or was still awaiting evaluation. Users
          were confused by the vagueness of the error message and felt further clarification
          was needed.
          </p>
          <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/1studentservice/errormessage.png"  alt="ut">
          </div>
          <p>
          <b>2. Course code inconsistencies in UBC database:</b> The tool showed the course would
          not transfer when the user indicated it was supposed to, or the course code was not
          the same between UBC and other school databases. This finding allowed us to conclude
          that there were certain inaccuracies within the UBC database, creating mistrust in
          the users.
          </p>
          <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/1studentservice/inconsistent.png"  alt="ut">
          </div>
          <p>
          <b>3. 'Change Search' button:</b> This button was meant to be an easy way for users to return
            to the search page without having to re-input general information such as institution
            name - users found the button difficult to find or expected it to be somewhere else.
          </p>

          <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
          <h2><b>What I learned</b></h2>
          <p>
            <b>1. Importantce of Piloting</b><br>
            As this was the first usability study I have ever conducted, I really felt the
            importance of piloting after planning out the test flow. The test flow sounded
            perfectly fine in my head, but in reality there were missing pieces such as testing
            equipment and unclear description in the scenario task that needed clarification.
            Having one or two people pilot the test flow really helped us flesh out all the nitty
            gritty details which made the actual testing a lot smoother.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Usability Study Protocol</b><br>
            There were many things I found particularly interesting about usability studies,
            such as having to tell the participant that they should not be afraid to critique
            the design or tool, and the rigorous consent and privacy regulations regarding
            user data. These were things that I had never thought about but made a lot of sense
            and helped me be more aware in my own daily life about saving data on the internet.
          </p>

          <h2><b>Limitations</b></h2>
          <p>
            Some limitations we have in this study was the lack of participants. Although the tool
             had already undergone three phases of pre-launch usability testing, we would have
             benefited from a larger sample size. Of the student participants that were tested,
             all three of them were transferring into the Faculty of Science, we may have gained
             more representative data and insight and if we ran tests on students transferring into
             other faculties.
          </p>

          <h2><b>Future Direction</b></h2>
          <p>
            Some improvements that can be made for a better user experience would be to make the
            ‘Change Search’ button more obvious or put it in a more identifiable location,
            specifying error messages, improving data reliability, and increasing exposure
            by improving the SEO of this tool.
