     <b>A mobile app to help travellers who are avid walkers find walking routes in a new city.</b>
   </h1>
   <p>
   <b>Tools Used:</b> Figma, Miro, Powerpoint, Pen and Paper.
  </p>
   <p>
     <b>Responsibilities:</b> I was part of a team of 4 students from disciplinary backgrounds.
     All students participated throughout the research and design process from January to March
     2020. Some of my responsibilities included conducting contextual inquiries, wireframing
     and prototyping, experiment design and performing, affinity diagram analysis, presenting
     and report writing.
   </p>
   <br>
   <br>
    <h1><b>Problem</b></h1>
    <p>
      In this era of information explosion, despite the plethora of travel guides
      such as blogs and travel websites, it is hard for travellers to find walking
      routes where they can get a sense of the city while accounting for their interests.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inspired by our personal experience with the
     <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9945861-city-walks">City Walks card deck</a>,
     we wanted to create a system that would allow travellers to explore the city on foot at
     their own pace without having to read through tons of travel blogs and articles.

         <h1><b>Research Question</b></h1>
         <p>
           How might we design a system for travellers who are avid walkers to find walking routes in
           a new city while accounting for their interests?

   <div class="overview">
    <h1><b>Field Study (Contextual Inquiry)</b></h1>
    <p>
      To learn more about the problem space we conducted a field study in the form of a
      <b>contextual inquiry</b> to understand how people make walking exploration decisions. Our
      field study consisted of two parts, the Planning stage and the Exploration stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <b>Planning stage</b>, we conducted a <b>semi-structured interview</b> where we inquired
      participants about their usual walking exploration behavior and asked them to plan
      a walking route on the spot as if they were to go on the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <b>Exploration stage</b>, we asked the participant to take us on the route that they
      just planned while we observed the participantâ€™s behavior and asked probing questions on
      the way to their destination.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Data Analysis</b></h1>
    <p>
      We conducted an affinity diagram analysis to understand the data we collected
      and find patterns and themes.
    </p>

    <br>


    <h1><b>Insights</b></h1>
    <p>
      From our field study, we learned that participants heavily relied on Google Maps
      and photos to help them come to a decision. In addition, participants often change
      their minds amidst their exploration and like to have options available to them when
      they change their minds. We also noticed that they way people new to the city (which
      we call travellers) and locals have different priorities in walking exploration.
      Thus, we decided our target users would be travellers and created several personas.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Low-Fidelity Paper Prototype (Ideate + Prototype)</b></h1>
    <p>
      With these takeaways in mind, we started to sketch out different ideas. Eventually, we
      decided to try out a list view prototype and a card deck view prototype that emphasized
      these traits.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/route1.jpg"  alt="route">
    </div>
    <p>
      However, after cognitive walkthroughs with several different users,
      we noticed that the card interface confuses people in terms of navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My team and I wondered if the card deck navigation was too novel and unfamiliar
      to users and whether a normal list view design would perform better in terms of
      explorability. Thus, we refined our card deck design and added signifiers that
      would hopefully make the navigation easier for users; and created a list view prototype
      so we could compare the two prototypes.

      <br>
      <br>


      <!-- <h1><b>Insights</b></h1>
      <p>
        We conducted an experiment to see if one prototype better supports explorability than
        the other. After performing an ANOVA analysis on the data we collected we were unable
        to conclude which layout type better supports explorability, however, we were able
        to identify key features that supported explorability in each of the prototypes.
        The overview screen in the List view helps users get a sense of what to expect;
        In the card view, participants enjoyed the larger images and less crowded texts.
        For future iterations, we can potentially combine the two layouts and let users
        choose dynamically between the List and a Card view.

      <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <!-- <h5><b>What I learned</b></h5>

      <h5><b>Limitations</b></h5> -->
      <p>
        One of the most challenging parts of this project was during the field study where
        we observed participants planning and going on a walk. It was hard to know which
        questions to ask to better understand how users conduct the task even with our
        pre-prepared list of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also challenging to decide on success metrics during the evaluation process
        to define which prototype performed better. This really came down to what we wanted
        to prioritize in the user experience of our product, we eventually decided on
        explorability. This reminded me to not judge an interface design before I understand
        what problem it is trying to solve first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of Figma as a prototyping tool may not have been the best. Though Figma
        offers an online collaborative environment, the limitations in the swiping interaction
        made testing the prototype challenging. If I were to do this project the second time
        I would choose to use a different prototyping tool for the card deck prototype.
        As well, if we had more time and werenâ€™t in the COVID pandemic, we would definitely
        have tested our prototype on more participants and standardized our experiment process
        as we had some sessions online and some in person.
      </p>
