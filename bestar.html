     <b>Evaluating the ecommerce user experience to increase conversion rate.</b>

     <b>Tools:</b> UserTesting, Moqups, AdobeXD, Pen and paper, Symplify, VWO, Google Analytics.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Responsibilities:</b>  I was the main UX Researcher/Designer for this client and I worked with
     a UI Designer who I consulted/did design reviews with, a Content Designer for copy, Software Engineering
     Lead, Design Director, Data Analyst, and Social Media Marketing Manager.
     <br>
     In this position, I evaluated the overall ecommerce user experience, contributed to a major
     redesign project (and design system update), and worked on several smaller projects (features)
     such as evaluating phone booking/ordering options, adding an NPS, and designing new theme landing pages.

       <h1><b>Challenge</b></h1>
       <p>
         How might we increase conversion rate of an ecommerce site through improved user experience?

<div class="overview">
    <h1><b>Project 1: Evaluation of Conversion Rate & Redesign</b></h1>
    <p>
      This was one of my main projects/objectives as the UX designer/analyst on the team.
      Everything else that I did tied into this project and the overall goal of increasing
      conversion rate for our ecommerce clients. We had a goal of increasing conversion rates
      from 0.3 to 0.7% or as close as we could to that.
   </p>
   <p>
      With this objective in mind, I gathered data from visitors and customers on the website
      through user research, usability testing, NPS surveys, and google analytics. Since I was
      in charge of this whole project on my own, I started by understanding the user journey and
      separating the user journey into different streams of tasks. After, I tested on one part of
      the journey at a time to discover user pain points and propose design solutions. These
      included testing specific task flows such as browsing to add to cart and cart to order etc.
      All the user research conducted contributed to the overall redesign.
    </p>
    <p>
      We launched the NPS in accordance with this goal and it was one of the first features that
      I worked on. I got to use and add to the current design system of the website/brand when creating
      the NPS UI.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Project 2: Adding NPS Feature</b></h1>
    <p>
      For the NPS feature, I started by doing competitive analysis and seeing how other ecommerce
      brands’ NPS looked like. I drafted wireframes and hi-fi mockups of the feature with the existing
      design system which went through several rounds of design critiques from my manager and designers
       from other teams. It was then passed on to development and built. We also made tweaks to the
       NPS user interface after launch and testing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Project 3: Designing new theme landing pages</b></h1>
    <p>
      There was a Work from Home landing page that wasn’t doing well and people kept dropping
      off after the animation banner/fold. Thus in order to improve the landing page we had a
      heatmap/click map on the landing page to evaluate which section was making users drop. We
      used the heat map to redesign the landing page sections that had low engagement and high
      drop offs and used the template of this landing page as a base for the two other theme landing pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project eventually spread out to be creating 2 other themed landing pages as per request
       from other departments. For the two other themed landing pages, I conducted competitive analysis
        on similar brands who had themed pages and took what was doing well into my mockup designs.
        I then conducted usability tests on the mockup landing pages and iterated a couple times from
         design critiques before passing on the wireframes to the UI designer.

    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Project 4: Launching Daily Specials Campaign</b></h1>
    <p>
      As an additional boost to increasing conversion rate I initiated a daily specials campaign
      that included updates to the current landing page, daily email newsletters that customers
      could subscribe to for reminders, and daily social media updates. I was in charge of making
      most of the promotional materials and keeping track of the analytics. In the end, we generated
      over $15000 on average a month from this campaign which ran for 6 months.

      <h1><b>Project 5: Social Media and Email Newsletter Engagement</b></h1>
      <p>
        During my time at Plogg, I was also in charge of creating graphics, instagram stories and other
        promotional materials for our ecommerce clients’ social media presence and weekly email newsletter.
        This included working with content designers to make sure that our content was in the right tone
        and in line with the branding. I monitored the newsletters and social media analytics to make
        sure that we had continuous growth and engagement from our audience. I also tested different
        email templates and best times to send emails/post stories for better engagement.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>


      <!-- <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <h5><b>What I learned</b></h5>
      <p>
        <b>1. Visual Design Process</b><br>
        Having come from a computer science background, I don’t have a lot of experience
        with visual design. While working closely with the graphic designer in my team,
        I got to learn more about their creative process and ways to seamlessly incorporate
        branding into a product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Working in a interdisciplinary team</b><br>
        During my internship, I got to work in an interdisciplinary team with engineers,
        product managers, and other designers. This made me realize the importance of
        communication and explaining design decisions to non-designers in a clear and
        non-jargon way. As well, I learned to create design systems for better hand off
        to developers.
      </p>
      <h5><b>Limitations and Future Direction</b></h5>
      <p>
        As time was limited, we were only able to do cognitive walkthroughs with a couple
        users on the early prototypes. In the future, more user testing on the prototype
        would be beneficial to validating the user flow and discovering any pain points that
        the design may have.
      </p>
      <p>
        My design was signed off for development at the end of my internship, so I look
        forward to seeing it be developed and iterated on as more testing happens in the
        development stages.
