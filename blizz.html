     <b>Designing a plant-based food subscription service for the taiwanese workforce.</b>
   </h1>
   <p>Blizz is a food subscription service aimed at helping workers in Taiwan eat
     more healthily by providing plant-based recipes that are nutritious and delicious.
   </p>

   <p>
     <b>Team:</b> 1 product designer, 1 product manager, 1 engineer, and 1 nutritionist
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Impact:</b> Owned the food subscription service experience from concept to development handoff
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Tools Used:</b> Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Powerpoint, Pen and Paper.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Duration:</b> 9 weeks.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Responsibilities:</b>  My main responsibilities included researching and understanding
     similar services (competitive analysis), wireframing, prototyping, creating a design system and copywriting.
   </p>
   <div class="spacer"></div>


   <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
   <p>
     In the fast paced cities of Taiwan, many workers have a hard time eating healthy and
     setting aside time to cook. Past research from
     <a href= "https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3416960"><b>Taiwan’s Ministry of Health</b></a>
     showed that over 40% of the taiwanese white-collar working population is overweight or obese due
     to long working hours and lack of exercise. They also discovered that 83% of office
     workers do not consume enough fruits and vegetables on a daily basis.

       <h1><b>Challenge</b></h1>
       <p>
         How might we design a service that helps workers in Taiwan eat more healthily while
         causing the least amount of disruption to their current lives?

<div class="overview">
    <h1><b>Introducing Blizz</b></h1>
    <p>
      Blizz is a plant-based food subscription service that aims to provide healthy and
      nutritious food to the working class population in Taiwan. Blizz allows subscribers
      to customize their box with quick and easy recipes that also cater to their fitness
      goals such as muscle gain, weight loss, or clear skin.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>User Flow</b></h1>
    <p>
      After discussing with the product manager and engineer on how they want the
      subscription process to work, I roughly planned out the user flow.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">

    </div>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Wireframes</b></h1>
    <p>
      I created wireframes for three different screen sizes (phone, tablet, and web)
      to demonstrate the user flow. Only showing the phone version here to save space.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">

    <p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Hi Fi Prototypes</b></h1>
      <p>
        Once the wireframes received approval from the team I started creating prototypes.
        I worked with the graphic designer to come up with different styles that matched
        the feeling of “clean, speed, energy, abundance” that the client asked for. Then
        based off of the chosen style, I created the rest of the prototype.

      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Final Design</b></h1>
      <p>
       After multiple iterations and changes to the prototype, we decided to change the
       branding a bit so that it looked more modern and clean.

      <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <h2><b>What I learned</b></h2>
      <p>
        <b>1. Visual Design Process</b><br>
        Having come from a computer science background, I don’t have a lot of experience
        with visual design. While working closely with the graphic designer in my team,
        I got to learn more about their creative process and ways to seamlessly incorporate
        branding into a product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Working in a interdisciplinary team</b><br>
        During my internship, I got to work in an interdisciplinary team with engineers,
        product managers, and other designers. This made me realize the importance of
        communication and explaining design decisions to non-designers in a clear and
        non-jargon way. As well, I learned to create design systems for better hand off
        to developers.
      </p>
      <h2><b>Limitations and Future Direction</b></h2>
      <p>
        As time was limited, we were only able to do cognitive walkthroughs with a couple
        users on the early prototypes. In the future, more user testing on the prototype
        would be beneficial to validating the user flow and discovering any pain points that
        the design may have.
      </p>
      <p>
        My design was signed off for development at the end of my internship, so I look
        forward to seeing it be developed and iterated on as more testing happens in the
        development stages.
      </p>
