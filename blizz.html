    <h1><b>Problem</b></h1>
    <p>
      In this era of information explosion, despite the plethora of travel guides
      such as blogs and travel websites, it is hard for travelers to find walking
      routes where they can get a sense of the city while accounting for their interests.
    </p>
    <p>
     With this in mind, we as a team of 4 students wanted to create a system that allowed
     users to explore the city at their own pace without having to read through tons of travel
     blogs and articles as travellers have limited time to spend in a city and don’t have extra
     time to spend searching.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h1><b>General Process</b></h1>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/designprocess.png"  alt="process">
    </div>
    <p>
      1. Empathize: User interviews/surveys, seeking to understand <br>
      2. Define: Pain points, prototyping personas, role objectives, challenges<br>
      3. Ideate: Share/diverge/converge ideas, determine MVP<br>
      4. Prototype: Mockups, simple storyboards, failing fast and iterating quickly<br>
      5. Test: Understand problems, what works, what doesn't work, and iterate<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Field Study (Empathize + Define)</b></h1>
    <p>
      To learn more about the problem space we conducted a field study to understand how
      people make walking exploration decisions. During the study, we would first ask
      participants questions regarding their usual walking exploration in the city, then,
      in the form of a contextual inquiry, we would ask the participants to decide on a
      place to go on the spot. We would observe the participant’s behavior and ask questions
      on the way to their destination.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/Fieldstudy.png"  alt="fieldstudy">
    </div>
    <p>
      From our field study, we learned that participants heavily relied on Google Maps and
      photos to help them come to a decision. In addition, participants often change their
      minds amidst their exploration and like to have options available to them when they
      change their minds. We also noticed that they way people new to the city (which we
      call travellers) and locals have different priorities in walking exploration. Thus,
      we decided our target users would be travellers and created several personas.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Low-Fidelity Paper Prototype (Ideate + Prototype)</b></h1>
    <p>
      With these takeaways in mind, we designed a rough card deck view
      prototype that emphasized these traits.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/route1.jpg"  alt="route">
    </div>
    <p>
      However, after cognitive walkthroughs with several different users,
      we noticed that the card interface confuses people in terms of navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      My team and I wondered if the card deck navigation was too novel and unfamiliar
      to users and whether a normal list view design would perform better in terms of
      explorability. Thus, we refined our card deck design and added signifiers that
      would hopefully make the navigation easier for users; and created a list view prototype
      so we could compare the two prototypes.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/card.jpg"  alt="route">
    </div>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/list.jpg"  alt="route">
    </div>
      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Experimenting with Medium-Fidelity Prototype (Test)</b></h1>
      <p>
        We conducted an experiment to see if one prototype better supports explorability than
        the other. After performing an ANOVA analysis on the data we collected we were unable
        to conclude which layout type better supports explorability, however, we were able
        to identify key features that supported explorability in each of the prototypes.
        The overview screen in the List view helps users get a sense of what to expect;
        In the card view, participants enjoyed the larger images and less crowded texts.
        For future iterations, we can potentially combine the two layouts and let users
        choose dynamically between the List and a Card view.
      </p>

      <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <p>
        One of the most challenging parts of this project was during the field study where
        we observed participants planning and going on a walk. It was hard to know which
        questions to ask to better understand how users conduct the task even with our
        pre-prepared list of questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also challenging to decide on success metrics during the evaluation process
        to define which prototype performed better. This really came down to what we wanted
        to prioritize in the user experience of our product, we eventually decided on
        explorability. This reminded me to not judge an interface design before I understand
        what problem it is trying to solve first.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice of Figma as a prototyping tool may not have been the best. Though Figma
        offers an online collaborative environment, the limitations in the swiping interaction
        made testing the prototype challenging. If I were to do this project the second time
        I would choose to use a different prototyping tool for the card deck prototype.
        As well, if we had more time and weren’t in the COVID pandemic, we would definitely
        have tested our prototype on more participants and standardized our experiment process
        as we had some sessions online and some in person.
      </p>
