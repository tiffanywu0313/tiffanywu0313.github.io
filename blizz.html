   <br>
   <h1>
     <b>A responsive web experience designed for a plant-based food subscription service.</b>
   </h1>
   <p>
     In the fast paced cities of Taiwan, many workers have a hard time eating healthy and
     setting aside time to cook. To save these people the time and effort of worrying about
     their diets, we set out to create a service that would cater to their needs. Thus,
     Blizz was created as a plant-based food subscription service that targets modern day
     people who are too busy to prepare, cook or eat healthy.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Tools Used:</b> Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Powerpoint, Pen and Paper.
   </p>
   <p>
     <b>Responsibilities:</b> I worked on this project during my internship at Huemon Design
     Agency this past summer. I worked in a team of 5 people including me (UX/UI designer),
     a graphic designer, a product manager, an engineer, and a marketing manager. My main
     responsibilities included wireframing, prototyping, copywriting, and researching CSR programs.
   </p>
   <br>
   <br>

    <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
    <p>
      Blizz was proposed by a startup client to the design agency I interned at, and were in
      the early stages when I joined to work on the web interface. I often participated in
      their discussions of brand positioning and core values.
    </p>

    <h5><b>Brand Character</b></h5>
    <p>
      Blizz wanted to have the characteristics of Educator, Leader, and Protector.

      </div>
    </p>

    <h5><b>Brand Mission</b></h5>
    <p>
     <b>1. Effective</b> - providing nutrients and health benefits for the body while decreasing
     metabolism burden.<br>
     <b>2. Convenient</b> - saving people time by providing food and nutritional knowledge.<br>
     <b>3. Sustainable</b> - using zero waste or sustainable packaging, as well as supporting
     local farmers.<br>
     <b>4. Delicious</b> - challenging the boundaries of good flavor by not adding additives and
     directly freezing fresh local produce.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h1><b>Branding Elements</b></h1>
    <p>
      These elements were already designed by the graphic designer before I started my internship.
      However, I was asked to incorporate these branding elements into the web design.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h5><b>Logo Design</b></h5>

      </div>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>User Flow</b></h1>
    <p>
      After discussing with the product manager and engineer on how they want the
      subscription process to work, I roughly planned out the user flow.
    </p>
    <div class="photo">
      <img src="./images/blizzuserflow.png"  alt="user flow">
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>


    <h1><b>Wireframes</b></h1>
    <p>
      I created wireframes for three different screen sizes (phone, tablet, and web)
      to demonstrate the user flow. Only showing the phone version here to save space.
    </p>

    <p>
      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Hi Fi Prototypes</b></h1>
      <p>
        Once the wireframes received approval from the team I started creating prototypes.
        I worked with the graphic designer to come up with different styles that matched
        the feeling of “clean, speed, energy, abundance” that the client asked for. Then
        based off of the chosen style, I created the rest of the prototype.

      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Final Design</b></h1>
      <p>
       After multiple iterations and changes to the prototype, we decided to change the
       branding a bit so that it looked more modern and clean.

      <br>
      <br>


      <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
      <h5><b>What I learned</b></h5>
      <p>
        <b>1. Visual Design Process</b><br>
        Having come from a computer science background, I don’t have a lot of experience
        with visual design. While working closely with the graphic designer in my team,
        I got to learn more about their creative process and ways to seamlessly incorporate
        branding into a product.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Working in a interdisciplinary team</b><br>
        During my internship, I got to work in an interdisciplinary team with engineers,
        product managers, and other designers. This made me realize the importance of
        communication and explaining design decisions to non-designers in a clear and
        non-jargon way. As well, I learned to create design systems for better hand off
        to developers.
      </p>
      <h5><b>Limitations and Future Direction</b></h5>
      <p>
        As time was limited, we were only able to do cognitive walkthroughs with a couple
        users on the early prototypes. In the future, more user testing on the prototype
        would be beneficial to validating the user flow and discovering any pain points that
        the design may have.
      </p>
      <p>
        My design was signed off for development at the end of my internship, so I look
        forward to seeing it be developed and iterated on as more testing happens in the
        development stages.
      </p>
