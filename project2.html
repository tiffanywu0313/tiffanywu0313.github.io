      How might we redesign yelp for university students planning a group outing

        <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
        <p>
          This was a course project that I worked on in a team of 5 students.
          We wanted to understand how people are using crowdsourced business recommendations on Yelp.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1><b>Pilot + Initial User Research</b></h1>
        <p>
          To learn more about the problem space, we wanted to conduct a user evaluation to
          learn how users are utilizing the platform and what the main pain points were.
          In our evaluation, we had a series of tasks that we would ask the user to complete
          while we observed, then, we would follow up with a short semi-structured interview
          asking the experience. After our pilot runs, we decided to print out the tasks list
          we asked each user to complete as users had a hard time remembering the details.
        </p>
        <div class="photo">
          <img src="./images/mini.png"  alt="mini">
        </div>
        <p>
          After analyzing the data we collected in the form of an Affinity Diagram, we learned
          that most users only use Yelp to look up recommendations of food when planning outings,
          and that the Yelp navigation feature (map too small or doesn’t show directions under 4
          blocks) and inconsistent filters were the major pain points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, we decided to further investigate how we can redesign Yelp so that it better
          supports planning a group outing with two or more people.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Cognitive walkthrough on low-fi</b></h1>
        <p>
          Based on feedback from the user evaluation, we split up into 2 small teams to
          brainstorm possible designs and came up with two conceptual designs. I was part
          of the team that came up with a map based design (similar to that of google maps).
          The other team’s design focused on tweaking components of the original design.
        </p>
        <p>Map based prototype</p>
        <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZqPL1x_g7c" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>List based prototype</p>
        <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXjJMKKZKiA" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>
          We performed a cognitive walkthrough of both lo-fi prototypes and decided to merge good
          ideas from both prototypes into one. Our mid-fi prototype was thus created after refining
          our lo-fi prototypes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Usability testing on mid-fi</b></h1>
        <p>
          Our Mid fi prototype was an interface that allowed users to create events where they can
          add other users, these events would become filters that the user can use to search for
          restaurants etc. This was also layered on top of a map based interface where the
          location/distance to and from the restaurant was easy to see.
        </p>
          <div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;">
            <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3_wMtuuDNFY" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          <p>
            To validate our solution, we conducted a user study with our mid-fi prototype. We made
            the user do multiple tasks on the prototype while talking aloud their thinking process
            and collected data from a follow up interview. Our results were quite positive as most
            users thought the interface was very straightforward to use.

          <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
          <p>
          Through this process, I’ve learned the importance of iteration on products as even when
          you think you’ve got all the problems down, users or your teammates will give feedback
          that will surprise you and is something you’ve never thought about. The challenging part
          about solving this problem was the lack of time we had and the similarity of the Yelp
          interface to other food/business recommendation related services. If we had more time,
          we would definitely have tested our prototypes on more people and had a better grasp of
          all possible pain points. If I were to do this again, I think I would try to have my
          teammates practice conducting usability testing more so our tests sessions were more
          consistent, as some teammates are better at probing during interviews than others etc.
