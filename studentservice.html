       <p>
         <b>Responsibilities:</b> I was part of a team of 4 student researchers, one lab coordinator,
        and one full time ux designer. Everyone participated throughout the research process
        from June to July 2019. Some of my responsibilities included planning out the research
        methodology, conducting usability studies, affinity diagram analysis, presenting findings
        and report writing.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       
       <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
       <p>
         UBC UX Lab is a hands-on program under UBC Student Communication Services where
         students learn about user experience and conduct experiments to improve the services
         that UBC provides its students.
       </p>
       <p>
         I was part of the summer 2019 cohort and I worked on two projects during my time as a
          UX student researcher, including conducting usability studies on the
          <a href="./studentservice2.html">Transfer credit search</a> tool and the
          “What can I do with my Science Degree” webpage.
       </p>
       <p>
         I will be focusing on the “What can I do with my Science Degree” webpage usability study
          below. You can read more about the Transfer credit search tool project
          <a href="./studentservice2.html">here</a>.
       </p>
       <p>
         The What can I do with my Science Degree” webpage was launched on May 22, 2019 by UBC
         Student Communication Services as a resource for students. Our goal was to understand
        how students are navigating the tool and to find if there are pain points.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>

        <h1><b>Research Question</b></h1>
        <p>
          How are science students navigating the What can I do with my Science Degree” webpage?
        </p>
        <div style="height:400px;overflow:scroll;">
          <img src="./images/Sciencedegree.png" alt="WCIDWMSD">
        </div>
        <p>
          This was what the web page looked like as of June 2019. (Note the Keep Exploring
          section is still an unsorted list of specializations in Science).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Methodology</b></h1>
        <p>
          To evaluate this webpage, we ran usability tests with UBC science students in different
           year levels that consisted of a survey, a perception test, and a follow up interview.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability study flow:<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Pre-screen Survey: this allowed us to understand the background of each user, such as
          what year level they are in, their future career prospect, and what they expect on the
          resource page etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Perception Test: students were allowed to freely browse the web page for 3-5 min
          with the <b>talk-aloud</b> method. This allowed us to find the pain points on the web page
          and take notice of certain functions that were not as intuitive.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Follow-up Questions: this allowed us to further question the user on their reaction to the
          web page and understand why they may have experienced certain issues.
        </p>
        <p>We also used Crazy egg, an analytics software to monitor the activity on the webpage from
           may to june so we could triangulate the data and find trends in user behavior.
         </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Data Analysis</b></h1>
        <p>
          We conducted an affinity diagram analysis to find pain points and themes on the data
          collected from 12 undergraduate science students.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>


          <h1><b>Insights</b></h1>
          <p>
            The goal of this research was to understand how students are navigating the webpage
            and to identify any pain points that the platform may have. Overall, the feedback we
            received was very positive. The following are key insights we found:

          </p>
          <br>
          <br>

          <h1><b>Solution</b></h1>
          <p>
            Following our presentation of findings and recommendations to the design team at UBC
            Students Services, a couple of changes were implemented to the web page. Most notably,
            <b>information on networking</b> was added, as well as <b>subheaders that split
            specializations into groups</b> for better navigation.
          </p>

            <img src="./images/Sciencedegreenew.png" alt="WCIDWMSD">
          </div>
          <p>
            This is what the web page looks like as of Oct 23, 2020.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>


          <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
          <h5><b>What I learned</b></h5>
          <p>
            <b>  1. Triangulating data is important for finding trends and patterns</b><br>
            Evaluating a solution with different methods helps us determine user behavior by
            cross-examining. For example, in this research we collected qualitative data from
            user interviews and quantitative data from web analytics that helped us validate
            that students are very interested in getting work, research, or volunteer experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Prioritize feedback </b> <br>
            User feedback is good, but don’t depend entirely on them. Users will always have
            more feature ideas than implementale, or want features that are contradictory.
            However, it is important for the designer to consider the goal of the platform
            and prioritize certain features over others.
          </p>

          <h5><b>Limitations and Future Direction</b></h5>
          <p>
            One major limitation we had in this study was that the sample size was quite small
            compared to the real population of UBC science students. However, according to an
            article written by Jakob Nielsen from the Nielsen Norman group, running many small
            tests with five users may be more efficient and potentially more effective than running
            elaborate usability tests with numerous users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another limitation was that the participants recruited for each year level were not
            representative of the UBC student population. Since the tests were conducted on campus,
            we were not able to recruit incoming or prospective students. Future usability testing
            on the page with these groups of students could be beneficial in understanding how
            these users navigate the page. Further research can also be conducted on the specialization
            pages with students from those specific specializations.
          </p>
