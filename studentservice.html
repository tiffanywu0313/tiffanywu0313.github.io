       <h1><b>Background</b></h1>
       <p>
         UBC UX Lab is a hands-on program under UBC Student Communication Services where
         students learn about user experience and conduct experiments to improve the services
         that UBC provides its students.
       </p>
       <p>
         I was part of the summer 2019 cohort and one of the projects I worked on was to conduct
         a usability study on the newly launched What can I do with my Science Degree webpage to
         understand how science students are navigating the web page.
       </p>
       <p>
         The What can I do with my Science Degree webpage was launched on May 22, 2019 by UBC
         Student Communication Services as a resource for students.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>

        <h1><b>Research Question</b></h1>
        <p>
          How are science students navigating the What can I do with my Science Degree webpage?
        </p>
        <div style="height:400px;overflow:scroll;">

        <p>
          The web page as of June 2019. (Note the Keep Exploring section is a unsorted
          list of specializations in Science).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Methodology</b></h1>
        <p>
          To evaluate this resource, we ran usability tests with UBC science students in different
          year levels that consisted of a survey, a perception test, and a follow up interview.
          Students were allowed to freely browse the web page for 3-5 min with the talk-aloud method.
          Our team scheduled weekly research pop-ups at the common areas of some of UBC's largest
          buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Pre-screen Survey: this allowed us to understand the background of each user, such as
          what year level they are in, their future career prospect, and what they expect on the
          resource page etc.<br>
          2. Perception Test: this allowed us to find the pain points on the web page and take notice
          of certain functions that were not as intuitive.<br>
          3. Follow-up Questions: this allowed us to further question the user on their reaction to the
          web page and understand why they may have experienced certain issues.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1><b>Data Analysis</b></h1>
        <p>
          We managed to collect data from a total of 12 undergraduate science students. To analyze
          the data, we created an affinity diagram to categorize similar trends.
        </p>

          <br>
          <br>


          <h1><b>Key Findings</b></h1>
          <p>
            While the general feedback we received was positive, and many users thought the web page
            was clean, organized and easy to read. There were some minor takeaways for our study:<br>
            1. Most users expected the specializations (Keep Exploring) section to be near the top as
            it was perceived to be more specific to each student and more helpful. As well, the list
            format of the specializations was troublesome to navigate as it was just by alphabetical
            order
          </p>
          <div class="photo">
            <img src="./images/specialization.png"  alt="ut">
          </div>
            <p>
              2. Some headers and subheaders looked too similar in font size
            </p>
            <div class="photo">
              <img src="./images/fontsize.png"  alt="ut">
            </div>
            <p>
              3. Since each specialization is different, the competitive edge section seemed to
              have bullet points that were too broad and general
            </p>
            <div class="photo">
              <img src="./images/competitive.png"  alt="ut">
            </div>
            <p>

              <a href="./images/WCIDWMSD.pdf">presentation</a>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>


          <h1><b>Reflection</b></h1>
          <p>
          One major limitation we had in this study was that the sample size was quite small
          compared to the real population of UBC Science students. However, according to an article
          written by Jakob Nielsen from the Nielsen Norman group, a leading UX research company,
          running many small tests with five users may be more efficient and potentially more effective
          than running elaborate usability tests with numerous users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another limitation was that the participants recruited for each year level were not
            representative of the UBC student population. Since the tests were conducted on campus,
            we were not able to recruit incoming or prospective students. Future usability testing
            on the page with these groups of students could be beneficial in understanding how
            these users navigate the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the usability testing, there are a few recommendations for the webpage content
            and layout. The first being to reconsider the location of the list of specializations
            on the page, or reformat the layout. The second being to make the bullet-point
            descriptions in the “Competitive Edge” section more specific to each specialization
            and relocate them to the respective specialization page. Further research can also be
            conducted on the specialization pages with students from those specific specializations.
